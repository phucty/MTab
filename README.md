This paper presents the design of our system, namely MTab, for Semantic Web Challenge on Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching (SemTab 2019). MTab combines the voting algorithm and the probability models to solve critical problems of the matching tasks. Results on SemTab 2019 show that MTab obtains promising performance for the three matching tasks.
